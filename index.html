        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 4, 2025</p>

        <p>
            This privacy policy describes how the 805StreetFoods mobile application ("the App") collects, uses, and protects your information.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> When you sign in using Apple Sign-In or Google Sign-In, we collect your email address and user identifier through Firebase Authentication</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> Display name, role (user/vendor/admin), and account preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usage Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect information about how you use the App, including screens viewed, actions taken, and feature usage</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects crash logs and error reports to help us improve app stability</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Firebase Performance monitors app performance metrics such as startup time and network latency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Food trucks you mark as favorites</li>
            <li><strong>Ratings & Reviews:</strong> Ratings you submit for food trucks</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Content:</strong> If you're a vendor, we store truck profiles, schedules, and events you create</li>
            <li><strong>Images:</strong> Vendors and admins can upload logos, banners, and food photos, which are stored in Firebase Storage</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Bug reports, feature requests, and other feedback you submit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Device & Notification Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Push Notification Tokens:</strong> Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) tokens and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) device tokens are collected to send you notifications about your favorited food trucks</li>
            <li><strong>Notification Preferences:</strong> Your notification settings and per-truck notification preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>

        <h3>Location (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>When In Use Only.</strong> When you grant location permission, your location is used <em>locally on your device</em> to calculate distances to food trucks and venues. Your location data is <strong>never sent to our servers or stored remotely</strong>. All distance calculations happen on your device.
        </p>

        <h3>Calendar (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
            Used <em>only</em> when you explicitly choose to add an event to your device's calendar via the "Add to Calendar" button. We <strong>never read</strong> your existing calendar events—we only write events you choose to add.
        </p>

        <h3>Photo Library (Vendors & Admins Only)</h3>
        <p>
            If you're a vendor or admin, you can select photos from your library to upload as truck logos, venue banners, or food photos. The App only accesses photos you explicitly select.
        </p>

        <h3>Push Notifications (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
            We request permission to send you notifications about food truck events for trucks you've favorited. You can enable or disable notifications at any time in iOS Settings or within the App.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication & Accounts:</strong> To manage your account and authenticate you when you sign in</li>
            <li><strong>Core Features:</strong> To display food truck schedules, venues, events, and enable favorites</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you reminders about food truck events for your favorited trucks</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Features:</strong> To enable vendors to create and manage their truck profiles and schedules</li>
            <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> To analyze usage patterns, fix bugs, and improve performance</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> To respond to your feedback, bug reports, and support requests</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication, Firestore database, Cloud Storage, Analytics, Crashlytics, Performance Monitoring, and Cloud Messaging</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Sign-In:</strong> For user authentication</li>

            <li><strong>Device Check (Apple):</strong> Firebase App Check uses Apple's Device Check framework to verify requests are coming from authentic devices, without collecting personal information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each service operates under its own privacy policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not sell or share</strong> your personal information with third parties for advertising purposes. We share data only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With the third-party services listed above to operate the App</li>
            <li>When required by law or to protect our rights</li>
            <li>With your explicit consent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> engage in cross-app tracking or use your data for targeted advertising.</p>

        <h2>Your Controls</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Retained while your account is active</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Content:</strong> Truck and venue data remains available until removed by the vendor or admin</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics & Crash Logs:</strong> Retained according to Firebase's standard policies (typically 60 days for raw data, longer for aggregate reports)</li>
            <li><strong>Deleted Accounts:</strong> Account data is removed within 30 days of deletion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS</li>
            <li>Firebase services use encryption at rest</li>
            <li>Access to backend systems is restricted and monitored</li>
            <li>We use Firebase App Check to prevent unauthorized API access</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Widget Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            The App includes a home screen widget that displays upcoming food truck events. Data is shared between the App and widget using iOS App Groups (a secure, on-device storage mechanism). No data is transmitted off your device for widget functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>Universal Links & Deep Linking</h2>
        <p>
            The App supports Universal Links (https://805streetfoods.com URLs) and URL schemes (streetfood://) to enable deep linking. When you open these links, your device may navigate directly to specific content within the App. No personal information is transmitted through these links.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date and, if appropriate, posting a notice in the App. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>
